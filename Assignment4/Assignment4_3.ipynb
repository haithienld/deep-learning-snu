    "In this notebook, you will learn how to implement conditional Genverative Adversarial Nets (cGANs) <br>\n",
    "The goal here is to build GANs that draw a face given its label. You can draw a black male/black female/white male/white female as you gives an input at the end of training. <br> \n",
